## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

There are many ways to make graphics in R.

- base R
- grid
- lattice graphics
- ggplot2

Nice overviews:

```{r cars}
hist(rnorm(1000))
```


## Including Plots

A ggplot2 template - Make any plot by filling in the parameters of this template

ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
<GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))

Like this:

ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

This would like:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut), stat = "count")
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
p = qplot(x = rnorm(1000),geom = "histogram")
p
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```
```{r}
n <- ggplot(mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplotly(n)
```
